Official White Paper:

Condensation

Game Legends is an E-Sports platform on which players will battle it out for playoff positioning hosted at the end of each year. Our goal is to make peoples dreams of being professional gamers possible by hosting the largest prizes ever. Matches will be verified on our Block Chain by trusted nodes (Referees) who will be payed for their efforts. Users will compete in our state of the art ELO system that will rank the most elite players in order.

Decentralization

"Power corrupts; Absolute power corrupts absolutely"
The power that Ethereum provides used to be a dream of mine. What it truly means in its most purest form, is complete decentralization of everything. Using this technology, we can create a network run by gamers all across the world; in order to shift the power from greedy corporations into the hands of gamers like you and I.

Automation

Each match outcome will be verified by Referees; nodes which will be elected and payed to do their jobs. If you do not agree with the match outcome, a fee may be paid to have your match voted on by our council. Finally, if you wish to challenge again, all nodes will be forced into voting on your match. On top of coins which are mined, there will be an additional 100 million GL Tokens which will be distributed over the next 100 years to the winners of our yearly playoffs and staff members.

Organization

Due to our autonomous, decentralized order; we can fully take part in society as one of the first ever decentralized non profit organizations. Our goal will be to distribute funds fairly, do our best to prevent cheating, and ultimately contribute to the decentralization of all things, including Game Legends. Although few things will be "decentralized" in the beginning, we will improve more and more as the tools required become complete and secure.
